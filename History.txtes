Origins
Lorem ipsum text traces its roots back to a classical Latin scholarly work from 45 BC called "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by the Roman philosopher Cicero. The specific passage used for lorem ipsum was discovered and connected to Cicero's work in 1982 by Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar.

Early Usage
The earliest known usage of lorem ipsum as placeholder text was in the 1500s, when an early printer took Cicero's text and scrambled the words to create a dummy Latin passage for laying out book pages. This allowed printers to have realistic text for testing layouts without being distracted by the actual content.
